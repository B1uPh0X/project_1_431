Project 1 CS 431
Your task is to make and program a dune OCaml project using
the  [ oplot ]  library, for mathematical plotting.

Try to provide a non-trivial application, not just a 'Hello, World'
program.

You must do some research and study, of course. If nothing else,
visit  the ecosystem at http://ocamlverse.net/, 
and https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/index-date.html.
