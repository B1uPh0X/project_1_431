Project 1 CS 431
Our task is to make and program a dune OCaml project using
the  [ oplot ]  library, for mathematical plotting.


We must do some research and study, of course. If nothing else,
visit  the ecosystem at http://ocamlverse.net/, 
and https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/index-date.html.

Our dune OCaml project revolves around taking the necessary factors of the central body and the orbiting body(ies) to calculate the ellipse points so then they can be graphed and shown using oplot.

Installations Needed:
    Opam (for installing the other packages listed below)
        OCaml
        dune
        oplot

You will need oplot and its dependency:

```opam install oplot```

```opam install gsl```

You will also need dune, get it with the following:

```sudo apt install ocaml-dune```
